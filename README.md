# belly-button-challenge

Full code can be found in StarterCode/static/js/app.js

We were able to populate the dropdown menu and implemented a function so that everytime we select a new data from the dropdown, the charts update to the right data.

Was not able to do the GAUGE CHART.

Github Pages has been set, but it is showing my README file info, my instructor Jose Barrera tried to help me fix this but there is no solution. 

Thank you!
