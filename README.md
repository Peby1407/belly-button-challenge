# belly-button-challenge

Full code can be found in StarterCode/static/js/app.js

We were able to populate the dropdown menu and implemented a function so that everytime we select a new data from the dropdown, the charts update to the right data.

Was not able to do the GAUGE CHART.

Github Pages has been set.

Thank you!
